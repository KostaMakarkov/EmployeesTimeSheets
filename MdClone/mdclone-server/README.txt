In this assignment i have worked with mongoDb, so in order to connect and set the basic mock data i prepared,
need to create a new database wit the name MdCloneDb, the db uri to connect is 'mongodb://localhost:27017/MdCloneDb',
if there is a different connection string you can change the db uri in the environments folder under .env

In order to run the project, run the command 'npm i' on path '../mdclone-server'
after all the packages installed run 'npm run dev'
